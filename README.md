## About Me

I'm a Web and Mobile developer based in Algeria with a strong focus on front-end development, while also building full-stack web applications. I work mainly with React and Next.js for the front-end also Expo for mobile, and handle backend logic using Node.js and Express, along with both SQL and NoSQL databases.

Alongside development, I have experience with UI/UX and visual design using Figma. I design interfaces, layouts, and visual assets for web platforms, especially when working solo on projects.

As Development Manager at GDG Constantine, I lead the development team, manage projects, and organize technical workshops and events. I'm also a tech instructor, sharing knowledge and helping others grow in their development journey.

In my creative time, I'm a pixel artist, creating 2D pixel characters and game assets for indie games. I collaborate with international developers on a freelance basis and pursue pixel art as a creative outlet.
